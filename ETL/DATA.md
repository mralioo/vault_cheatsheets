## sparsity

Sparse data isÂ **a variable in which the cells do not contain actual data within data analysis**. Sparse data is empty or has a zero value. Sparse data is different from missing data because sparse data shows up as empty or zero while missing data doesn't show what some or any of the values are.
examples of sparse data : 

* sparse features include vectors of one-hot-encoded words or counts of categorical data.
*  a **new variable dimensioned by MONTH for which you do not have data for past months**
