## Intro 

**MLflow** is an open-source platform to manage the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, deployment, and a central model registry. It includes the following components:

-   **Tracking** – Record and query experiments: code, data, configuration, and results
-   **Projects** – Package data science code in a format to reproduce runs on any platform
-   **Models** – Deploy ML models in diverse serving environments
-   **Registry** – Store, annotate, discover, and manage models in a central repository
