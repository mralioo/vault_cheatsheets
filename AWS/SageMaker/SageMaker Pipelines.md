At a high level a SageMaker Pipeline is built through a series of orchestrated [**steps**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/build-and-manage-steps.html). You can define different step types such as a [**Training Step**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/build-and-manage-steps.html#step-type-training) or a [**RegisterModel Step**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/build-and-manage-steps.html#step-type-register-model). Using the SageMaker SDK you can build these steps out in Python and once executed a visual [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) is created that displays your workflow.
