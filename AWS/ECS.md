Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) helps **schedule and orchestrate containers across a fleet of servers**. It involves installing an agent on each container host that takes instructions from the ECS control plane and relays them to the local Docker image on each one. ECS makes this easy by providing an [optimized Amazon Machine Image (AMI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html) that launches automatically using the ECS console or [CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_CLI.html) and that you can use to launch container hosts yourself.
