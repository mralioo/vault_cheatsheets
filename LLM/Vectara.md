Sure, here's an explanation of each key in the Vectara response from the RAG system:

1. **'text'**: This key contains the text snippet extracted from the document or corpus being analyzed. In this example, it's a statement encouraging individuals to request reasonable accommodations for interviews.

2. **'score'**: This key provides the relevance score assigned to the text snippet by the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. The score indicates how well the text matches the query or context provided.

3. **'metadata'**: This key contains additional information about the text snippet, organized as a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary in the list represents a metadata field associated with the snippet. In this example:
   - 'name': 'title' indicates the title of the document or section where the text is located.
   - 'name': 'lang' indicates the language of the text (in this case, English).
   - 'name': 'section' indicates the section number or identifier.
   - 'name': 'offset' indicates the character offset where the snippet begins.
   - 'name': 'len' indicates the length of the snippet in characters.

4. **'documentIndex'**: This key provides the index of the document or snippet within the corpus being analyzed.

5. **'corpusKey'**: This key contains information about the corpus or dataset being searched by the RAG system. It includes details such as the customer ID, corpus ID, semantics, dimension, metadata filter, and lexical interpolation configuration.

6. **'resultOffset'**: This key indicates the starting index of the result within the entire corpus or dataset.

7. **'resultLength'**: This key indicates the length of the result, i.e., the number of characters in the snippet.

These keys provide essential information about the context, relevance, and location of the text snippet returned by the RAG system in response to a query or search request.
