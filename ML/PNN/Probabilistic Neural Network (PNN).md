A probabilistic neural network (PNN) is a sort of feedforward neural network used to handle classification and pattern recognition problems. In the PNN technique, the parent probability distribution function (PDF) of **each class is approximated using a Parzen window and a non-parametric function**. The PDF of each class is then used to estimate **the class probability of fresh input data,** and Bayes’ rule is **used to allocate the class with the highest posterior probability to new input data**. With this method, the possibility of **misclassification is lowered**. This type of ANN was created using a Bayesian network and a statistical approach known as Kernel Fisher discriminant analysis.
