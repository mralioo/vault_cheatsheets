## What is XGBoost ? 
**XGBoost** is an acronym for **Extreme Gradient Boosting**. It is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve classification and regression problems.
* It is an implementation of **gradient boosted trees** designed for speed and accuracy.
*  It has proved to be a highly effective machine learning algorithm extensively used in machine learning competitions
* It has high predictive power and is almost 10 times faster than other gradient boosting techniques. It also includes a variety of regularization parameters which reduces overfitting and improves overall performance. Hence, it is also known as **regularized boosting** technique.
